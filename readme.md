# Overview 
This plugin enables opening embedded chromium browsers inside intelij. It uses 
[JxBrowser](https://www.teamdev.com/jxbrowser). It is developed for the mac but you should be able to create a build 
that works on any of the platforms that JxBrowser supports.

The project is in alpa status but it can open multiple functioning browser windows.
 
# Getting started

Download an embedded JxBrowser version for your platform along with a 
license for yourself and place it in the lib directory of `blast.browser`
 (need to figure out how the open source license works).
